"""
Model probing callback of embedding estimators
==============================================

This notebook will show you how to investigate the **data representation given
by an embedding estimator during training**  (such as SimCLR, y-Aware
Contrastive Learning or Barlow Twins) using the notion of "probing".
A standard machine learning model (e.g. linear or SVM) is trained and evaluated
on the data embedding for a given task as the model is being fitted. It allows
the user to understand what concepts are learned by the model.

This has been first introduced by Guillaume Alain and Yoshua Bengio in 2017
[1]_ to understand the internal behavior of a deep neural network along
the different layers. This technique aimed at answering questions like: what is
the intermediate representation of a neural network? What information is
contained for a given layer ?

Then, it has been adapted to benchmark self-supervised vision models
(like SimCLR, Barlow Twins, DINO, DINOv2) on classical datasets (ImageNet,
CIFAR, ...) by implementing linear probing and K-Nearest Neighbors probing
on model's output representation.

# Unsupervised Contrastive Learning on MNIST
# ------------------------------------------
#
# For illustration purposes on how to use the probing callback, we will focus
# on the handwritten digits dataset MNIST. It contains 60k training images and
# 10k test images of size 28x28 pixels. Each image contains a digit from 0 to
# 9. It is rather small-scale compared to modern datasets like ImageNet but
# sufficient to illustrate the probing technique.
# We will train a SimCLR model on these data and probe the learned
# representation using a logistic regression classifier on the digit
# classification task. It will show how the data embedding evolves during
# training to become more linearly separable for each digit class.

# Conclusions
# -----------
#
# In this notebook, we have shown how to use the model probing callbacks
# available in nidl to monitor the evolution of the data representation
# during training of embedding models such as SimCLR and y-Aware Contrastive
# Learning. We have seen how to use the `ModelProbing` callback for
# **single-task probing** and **multi-task probing**.
# These callbacks allow to train standard machine learning models (e.g.
# logistic regression, ridge regression, SVM) on the learned representation
# at regular intervals during training and log the relevant metrics to
# TensorBoard. This provides insights on what concepts are being learned by
# the model and how the representation evolves to become more suitable for
# downstream tasks.
