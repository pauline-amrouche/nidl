Self-Supervised Learning with Barlow Twins
===================================================

This tutorial will show you how to fit and evaluate a Barlow Twins
model [1]_ on the OpenBHB dataset using NIDL.

We will follow these steps using the NIDL library:

1. Load the OpenBHB dataset.
2. Define the data augmentations for self-supervised training.
3. Define the BarlowTwins model.
4. Train the model.
5. Visualize the model's embedding using MDS and evaluate its
   performance on age prediction using linear regression and KNN.

As for the neuroimaging data, we will investigate two input representations:

- Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) maps, which are preprocessed gray matter
  density maps.
- Surface-based morphometry (SBM) maps, which are cortical thickness, mean
  curvature, gray matter volume and surface area maps projected onto a
  standard surface template.

  Both representations are available in the OpenBHB dataset. To make the
  training faster and reduce the memory footprint, we will consider regions
  of interest (ROIs) instead of the whole brain. For VBM, we will
  use the mean gray matter density averaged within each ROI of the
  Neuromorphometrics atlas (284 regions). For SBM, we will use the cortical
  thickness, mean curvature, gray matter volume and surface area averaged
  within each ROI of the Desikan-Killiany atlas (68 regions).

  The Barlow Twins model will be trained individually on both
  representations and we will compare their performance on age prediction.

Setup

This notebook requires some packages besides nidl. Let's first start with
importing our standard libraries below:

OpenBHB datasets and data augmentations for Barlow Twins training
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We will use the OpenBHB dataset for pre-training the models. We will focus
on the VBM ROI representation and the SBM ROI representation for this
tutorial. Since they are tabular data, we will use random masking and
adding Gaussian noise as data augmentation in contrastive learning.

    mask_prob = 0.8

            lambda x: x.flatten(),
            lambda x: (np.random.rand(*x.shape) > mask_prob).astype(np.float32)
            * x,  # random masking

Training of BarlowTwins models
-----------------------------------------------

We can now instantiate and train two Barlow Twins models (one
for VBM and another for SBM).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 244-248

Since we work with tabular data, we can use a simple MLP as encoder. For
VBM data, the input dimension is 284 and we compress the data to a 32-d
vector. SBM data is flattened to a 272-d vector (68 regions * 4 features)
and we also compress it to a 32-d vector.

Visualization and evaluation of the learned representations
--------------------------------------------------------------

In order to visualize the learned representations of both models, we apply
a widely used dimensionality reduction technique: Multi-Dimensional Scaling
(MDS). This technique project the points in a lower-dimensional space such
that the pairwise distances between points are preserved as much as possible.
Then, we evaluate the learned representations on age prediction using linear
regression and KNN regression.

We first extract the embeddings of the training and test sets for both VBM
and SBM data.

**Observations**: From the MDS visualizations, we can observe that both VBM
and SBM embeddings show a gradient of ages, indicating that the models have
learned to organize the data in a way that reflects age similarity. However,
the VBM embeddings appear to have a more continuous distribution of ages
compared to SBM. This suggests that VBM may capture age-related features
more effectively than SBM in this context. This is confirmed when looking at
the age prediction results, where VBM outperforms SBM for both linear
regression and KNN regression. However, the results can be improved by
working with the original 3d brain scans instead of the ROI-averaged data.
